It has been a busy summer. With the new semester and all, I'm trying to stay organised and keep my projects in line. So, I'll be using this blog as an ELN, and hope to finally stick to Jupyter notebooks and link these too. 

I'm going over my pipeline for the RNA-seq project, and will be running the analysis from scratch -- this will be nice because I can document the project in the notebook too. 

*Today*
-[ ] prepare for ANSC-255 lab (split fish, prep feed for students, write weekly quiz and print)
-[ ] troubleshoot DNA extraction from biofilter samples for FWI collaboration (is it a Qubit issue? Should run a gel)
-[ ] look over QC reports for RNA-seq project and see if I can get FASTQC to spit out a combined report? 
-[ ] look into normalizing reads and checking for sequence duplication levels
