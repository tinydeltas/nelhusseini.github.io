Time is flying by! It's already Thursday and I have to prepare for tomorrow's group meeting. I've been still getting settled into the semester and I've spent a lot of time prepping for the student's experiment for my TA class, but things ~~should~~ settle down by next week. I'm workshopping a few ideas for possible high risk-high gain experiments. 

RNA-seq analysis is going... okay? I'm not sure that removal of duplicate sequences is going to work. CLC is removing ~75-80% of the reads. This is going to normalize all samples and remove any variation due to treatment (my guess). But I'll see what happens. Also, I think I can use the new Vienna assembly! I was able to map my trimmed reads to it. I will need an annotation file eventually, but I'm hoping Dr. Tobasei can help me on this. 

I heard back from the company I asked for a quote on a chiller for the ATL. Due to the number of tanks + no insulation, they recommend a 5 hp chiller. This is TOO BIG! Will try to cut down to 10 tanks, and add insulation to size down. I'll work on an experimental design and send to Ali for review today. 

I didn't get a chance to troubleshoot the DNA extraction yesterday. I will do that tomorrow morning.
