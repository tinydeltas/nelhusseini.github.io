# Hi there, I'm Nour El Husseini!

I'm a pre-candidate doctoral student in the Department of Animal and Avian Sciences at University of Maryland, College Park. I'm passionate about providing food security through sustainable aquaculture.

For my undergraduate studies, I attended the American University of Beirut (AUB) in my hometown of Beirut, Lebanon. At AUB, I was a part of the Agricultural Engineering program, which sends third year students to the AREC campus Bekaa valley, giving students ample land to put theory to practice. I ran an aquaponics experiment, and my love for aquaculture was born. The experiment failed miserably. Still, I loved aquaculture and wanted to learn more.

I enrolled in Auburn University's Master of Aquaculture program in summer 2017. Auburn's E.W. Research Fisheries Station is a world renowned and world class facility; home to much of the pioneering research in pond aquaculture.
